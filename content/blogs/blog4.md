# 1.
## Sella Ronda
For ski Enthusiasts there are few places that can compete with Sella Ronda. Located in Northen Italy, in the Sella massif. It is one of the biggest connected ski areas in the Alps. It is possible to make a circle around the whole massif only using skis and it is a cool challenge for skiers to do in one day.It gives access to more than 500 km of ski pistes. The cable car system is also very new, and refurbished each season, so wait times are okay even in peak season. The only down side is that the activities after ski are limited as all of the places along the Sella are very small.

## St.Moritz

The poshest of all the ski destinations in the Alps, is visited by the rich and elites of Europe each year with good reason.Located in Switzerland, it offers a massive Ski complex of 155 km, enough to satisfy even the fastest and fittest ski maniacs. It is also very modern and even has a michelin stared restaurant a top of a mountain. St.Moritz is also a beautiful town with incredible hotels, shops and restuarants.
