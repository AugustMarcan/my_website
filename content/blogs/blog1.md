title: Comparative Analysis of selected CEE banks
---

The image shows a snapshot from my comparative analysis of 2 Croatian and 2 Austrian Banks. It shows their market caps in EUR as well as the dividend yield and some key ratios.

## Market Cap
The Croatian banks are much smaller and are subsidiaries of larger European banks, while the Austrians are HQs of multinational banks.

## Dividend Yield
Croatian banks pay out much higher dividend yields then the Austrian banks. That can be due to the Croatian banks being undervalued, which drives the yield up as yield is Dividend/Price. Alternatively it can be a reflection of the risk, as Austrian banks are considered safer, and therefor Croatian banks need to offer higher dividend yield to attract capital investors. 

## Key Ratio Analysis
### P/B and P/E
P/B is a common ration when analyzing financial institutions. It reflects the price that equity investors are paying for each monetary unit of shareholder equity in the books. In general a ratio higher than 1 indicates that the bank is overvalued, while inversely a ratio lower then 1 signals that the bank is undervalued. As we can see, Croatian banks are pricier than Austrian banks according to this indicator. They are also more expansive according to the well known P/E. 

## Summary
Croatian banks are much smaller, payout higher dividend and are considered riskier than Austrian banks.
